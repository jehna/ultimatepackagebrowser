Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses\n a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries\n to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from\n cron.\n .\n Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation\n from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate\n are:\n .\n  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only\n    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does\n    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for\n    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate\n    does this as well, but not the original locate.\n .\n  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time\n    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its\n    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without\n    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding\n    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.\n .\n Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to\n mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may\n wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,\n otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself\n (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).\n Also, you may wish to remove the \"locate\" package in order not to have\n two different database files updated regularly on your system.","dependencies":["libc6","adduser"],"forwardDependencies":[]},{"name":"module-init-tools","description":"tools for managing Linux kernel modules\n This package contains a set of programs for loading, inserting, and\n removing kernel modules for Linux.","dependencies":["libc6","upstart-job"],"forwardDependencies":["initramfs-tools","linux-image-3.2.0-35-generic","linux-image-3.2.0-29-generic","acpid","udev","ubuntu-minimal","powermgmt-base"]},{"name":"mount","description":"Tools for mounting and manipulating filesystems\n This package provides the mount(8), umount(8), swapon(8),\n swapoff(8), and losetup(8) commands.","dependencies":[],"forwardDependencies":["fuse","initscripts"]},{"name":"mountall","description":"filesystem mounting tool\n mountall mounts filesystems when the underlying block devices are\n ready, or when network interfaces come up, checking the filesystems\n first.","dependencies":["makedev","udev","plymouth","coreutils","libc6","libdbus-1-3","libnih-dbus1","libnih1","libplymouth2","libudev0"],"forwardDependencies":["plymouth","upstart","initscripts"]},{"name":"mtr-tiny","description":"Full screen ncurses traceroute tool\n mtr combines the functionality of the 'traceroute' and 'ping' programs\n in a single network diagnostic tool.\n .\n As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host\n mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host.
